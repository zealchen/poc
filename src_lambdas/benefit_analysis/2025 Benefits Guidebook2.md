# Introduction to Jordan's Benefit Plans

## About This Guide
This Benefits Information Guidebook provides an easy-to-understand, general explanation of the more significant provisions of the Jordan's Furniture, Inc. Employee Benefits Plan (the "Plan") and its benefit options. The benefits and premiums are subject to change at the sole discretion of Jordan's Furniture. We've made every effort to make this guide as accurate as possible. If there is any difference between the information in this guide and the provisions of the Plan, or if any provision is not covered or only partially covered, the terms of the Plan will govern in all cases. At any time, you may contact the Benefits Department to request to examine the individual plan documents.

## Personal Information
At Jordan's we work hard to provide our employees with a highly competitive and very comprehensive benefits package. We only select benefits providers who have an impeccable reputation and who are the leaders in their field of expertise. To effectively communicate and market our diverse benefits programs to employees we may share your personal information with these companies. You can rest assured that our contracts with these business providers requires that all employee and company information remain strictly confidential and allows them to use the information only for the purpose for which it was intended.

## We Offer a Wide Range of Benefits
Each employee has different security and financial needs, and our wide range of benefit programs are designed to recognize these differences by providing choices in many coverage areas. Together, the programs make up an excellent benefits package, designed with you in mind!

## Eligibility
You are eligible to participate in the Plan if you are:
* A regular Full-Time Employee normally scheduled to work 35 hours or more per week
* A regular Part-Time Employee normally scheduled to work between 24 and 34 hours per week (with some limitations)

If you have a question regarding your eligibility, check with the Benefits Department.

*Note:* You do not have to enroll in any of Jordan's benefit programs. However, if you waive coverage, you will not have the option to enroll during the year unless you have a qualifying event. (See the section titled "Qualifying Events" on page 7).

## Coverage Effective Dates

### Full-Time new hires:
* You can enroll in our plans immediately. All benefits, except disability coverage and the 401(k) Savings Plan, become effective following 30 days of full-time employment.

### Part-Time new hires:
* You can enroll in our medical, dental, and flexible spending account plans immediately. All benefits, except the 401(k) Savings Plan, become effective following 30 days of part-time employment.
* If your employment status changes to full-time, you will be eligible for the Life, AD&D, Vision, Legal Insurance, Identity Theft Protection, and Group Home and Auto plans following 30 days of employment.

3
full-time employment, and you will be eligible for the disability insurance plans following 6 months of full-time employment.

Existing employees can enroll in our benefit plans each year during Jordan's open enrollment period.

Medical, Dental, and Flexible Spending coverage will cease five (5) calendar days following the date your employment terminates, consistent with the terms of those plans and applicable law. All other benefits will cease the date your employment terminates, consistent with the terms of those plans and applicable laws.

## Paying for Your Benefits

You pay for your portion of the cost of benefits through weekly payroll deductions. The contributions you make for certain benefits will be deducted from your paycheck on a pre-tax basis.

A pre-tax deduction is made before Social Security (FICA), federal income tax, and state income taxes (in MA) are taken out of your paycheck. As a result, your taxable income is reduced, allowing you to save money on taxes.

The table below lists the benefit plans for which the costs are deducted before and after taxes.

| Pre-Tax Plans | After-Tax Plans |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Medical | Supplemental Life Insurance |
| Dental | Supplemental Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance |
| Health Care Flexible Spending Account | Supplemental Long Term Disability Insurance |
| Limited Purpose Flexible Spending Account | Legal |
| Health Care Savings Account | Group Home and Auto Insurance |
| Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account | Critical Illness |
| Vision | |
| 401(k) | Roth 401(k) |

## Eligible Family Members

You are eligible to elect coverage for:
- Your spouse or domestic partner (Note: your spouse is the person to whom you are legally married. It does not include a spouse from whom you are legally separated or divorced unless required by your divorce decree).
- Your unmarried or married child(ren) or those of your spouse. Coverage continues through the end of the month in which the dependent turns age 26.
- Coverage may be extended for children over age 26 that are incapable of self-care because of a physical or mental disability.

You may select different coverage levels for your medical and dental benefits. For example, you can enroll your entire family in dental coverage, and enroll only yourself in medical coverage.
# Covering a Domestic Partner

You may elect to cover a domestic partner in lieu of a spouse. To qualify, both you and your domestic partner must have a signed, dated, and notarized affidavit and other supporting evidence attesting that you have an exclusive, committed relationship that has been established for 24 months or more. Examples of supporting evidence may include:
* 24 consecutive months of bank or other financial statements showing joint accounts and the date established
* Joint lease or mortgage

For information about covering your domestic partner, please contact the Benefits Department.

## Cost to Cover a Domestic Partner (Non-Qualified Dependent)

A domestic partner is not recognized by the Federal government as a qualified dependent. You may provide medical, dental or vision coverage for a non-qualified dependent, however specific tax rules apply:
* Weekly contributions for medical, dental and/or vision coverage for a non-qualified dependent will be on a pre-tax basis.
* Employees with a domestic partner will incur state and federal taxes on the value of medical, dental and/or vision coverage. The value is called "Imputed Income".

Under Federal regulations a non-qualified dependent is not considered a "legal spouse or beneficiary" for tax purposes. Therefore, claims submitted for reimbursement under the Health Savings Account and Flexible Spending Account are not eligible expenses.

## Jordan's Pays 100% of the Cost for Some Benefits

Jordan's pays 100% of the cost for the following benefits for Full-Time Employees:
* Short-Term and Long-Term Disability Insurance
* Basic Life Insurance and Basic Accidental Death & Dismemberment Insurance
* Identity Theft
* Fees associated with your Health Savings Account and Flexible Spending Accounts

## Voluntary Benefits

The following benefits are voluntary, and the employee pays 100% of the cost if they elect coverage:
* Supplemental Life Insurance and Supplemental Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance for employee, spouse/domestic partner, and children
* Supplemental Long Term Disability Insurance
* Flexible Spending Accounts
* Health Savings Account
* Critical Illness
* Legal Plan
* Vision Plan
* Group Home and Auto Insurance

The company does not profit in any way by offering these benefits but does incur costs associated with administering them on your behalf.

# Changing Your Elections

The benefits you elect will be in effect from your effective date through December 31ˢᵗ of each year.

IRS regulations do not allow you to make changes to your elections unless you have a change in your family or employment status (referred to as a "Qualifying Event"). Any change you make must be due to, and consistent with, your Qualifying Event.

To add a dependent, the employee must be enrolled in the plan, unless there has been a qualifying event that resulted in loss of coverage.
You must make the change to your coverage by notifying the Benefits Department within 31 days from the date of the qualifying event and by providing proper documentation supporting the change.

## Qualifying Events

Below is a list of Qualifying Events that would permit you to change your benefit elections:
- Marriage, divorce, or legal separation
- Death of your spouse, domestic partner, or dependent child(ren)
- Change in your employment status or that of your spouse, domestic partner, or adult child(ren) (e.g., changes from Full-Time to Part-Time or loss of employment)
- Birth or adoption of a child
- Taking or returning from an unpaid leave of absence
- Involuntary loss of other employer-sponsored health coverage
- A child no longer qualifying as a dependent.

## About Cigna's Open Access Plus High Deductible Health Plan (Cigna OAP HDHP)

Cigna's Open Access Plus High Deductible Health Plan is a qualified high deductible PPO health plan with a Health Savings Account. This plan is designed to help members save money on their weekly premium and put money aside in a Health Savings Account (HSA) to help offset medical costs.

* Most services and prescriptions are subject to the plan deductible ($2,600 for an individual plan and $5,200 for employee + 1 and family plans). After you have met your deductible, the plan covers 100% of your in-network medical services. Primary Care visits, Specialists visits, ER visits and prescriptions are subject to a copayment.

* Services for annual visits, preventative tests and prescriptions for preventative drugs that treat chronic conditions and illnesses are not subject to the plans deducible; however, you will pay the applicable copayment for these prescriptions.

* A lower co-payment applies to some outpatient services, including most primary care, obstetrical care, gynecological care, mental health care, and substance abuse rehabilitation.

* A higher co-payment applies to most specialists and outpatient specialty care.

* The family deductible may be met by any combination of covered family members. For example, one member of the plan may incur a deductible of up to $5,200, the deductible is not capped at $2,600 per individual.

After you have reached this maximum, your medical and prescription expenses are covered in full for the rest of the year.

* Out-of-network services are covered services that you receive from a non-participating provider. Receiving out-of-network services typically means higher out-of-pocket costs. The annual maximum out-of-pocket expense you would pay for out-of-network services is $7,500 per person or $15,000 for a family plan. After you have reached this maximum, your medical and prescription expenses are covered in full for the rest of the year.

* Consider contributing to a Health Savings Account to pay for medical expenses associated with this plan. Refer to page 24 for details on the Health Savings Account.

## About the Cigna's Open Access Plus In-Network HMO (Cigna OAPIN HMO)

## About Cigna's Open Access Plus PPO (Cigna OAP PPO)

Cigna's Open Access Plus PPO is a plan with a higher premium that doesn't require a PCP or referrals and gives you the flexibility to go out of the Cigna Network.

* Designation of a Primary Care Physician (PCP) and referrals to specialists are not required.
* In-network services are covered services that you receive from a Cigna participating provider. Typically, receiving in-network services means lower out-of-pocket costs. While certain in-network services are subject to an annual deductible, many others are covered with co-payments or at no charge.
* A lower co-payment applies to some outpatient services, including most primary care, obstetrical care, gynecological care, mental health care, and substance abuse rehabilitation.
* A higher co-payment applies to most specialists and outpatient specialty care.
* Staying in the network provides you with a higher level of coverage and requires that you pay less out of your own pocket for these services.

* For out-of-network services you typically pay higher out-of-pocket, once you've met your deductible, you typically pay 20% coinsurance.
* The annual maximum out-of-pocket expense you would pay is $4,000 per person or $8,000 for a family plan. After you have reached the maximum, your medical and prescription expenses are covered in full for the rest of the year.

# Life and AD&D Insurance

## Basic Life Insurance Coverage

Jordan's automatically provides all regular Full-Time Employees with group term life insurance, through Reliance Standard, following 30 days of continuous active employment. You are covered under this plan if you remain an active, Full-Time Employee at Jordan's.

The amount of your life insurance is equal to one times your annual salary (calculated as of June 1st every year) with a minimum benefit of $50,000 and a maximum benefit of $325,000. The amount of life insurance coverage for Sales Consultants, who have completed their Initial Sales Period, will be based on their February PTO rate (See Employee Handbook for Details).

You must designate a beneficiary for this plan by logging into the ADP Employee Self-Service portal (my.adp.com) and clicking on Benefits.

The IRS allows employers to provide employees with up to $50,000 of group-term life insurance as a tax-free benefit. The cost of group-term life insurance in excess of $50,000 is taxable. The value of this benefit is spread over the year and added to your gross income each week as "Imputed Income." The IRS treats this as additional compensation subject to FICA withholding and federal and state income taxes. This is not a deduction from your gross pay but appears every week on the "Other Benefits and Information" section of your pay stub under GTL (Group Term Life). The additional tax that you pay is not significant. The IRS uses a table to determine the cost of group-term life insurance coverage and the cost is based on your age at the end of the tax year.

## Basic Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) Insurance Coverage

Jordan's automatically provides all regular Full-Time Employees with group term AD&D Insurance, through Reliance Standard, following 30 days of continuous active employment. You are covered as long as you remain an active, full-time employee at Jordan's.

The amount of your AD&D insurance is equal to one times your annual salary (calculated as of June 1st every year) with a minimum benefit of $50,000 and a maximum benefit of $325,000. The amount of coverage for Sales Consultants who have completed their Initial Sales Period will be based on their February PTO rate (See Employee Handbook for Details).

You must designate a beneficiary for this plan by logging into the ADP Employee Self-Service portal (my.adp.com) and clicking on Benefits. Please note that AD&D Insurance is only paid if the employee's death is classified as accidental.

The amount of your Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment coverage will be reduced by 35% at age 70 and will be reduced by 50% at age 75.

## Portability and Conversion

If your employment is terminated, your coverage ends due to a status change, or your coverage is reduced because of termination or amendment of the Group Policy, you may be able to continue your coverage under the portability or conversion options of the plan.

# Flexible Spending Accounts

Jordan's offers two types of health Flexible Spending Account to regular Full-Time and regular Part-Time Employees. These plans are administered by Optum Financial. Your eligibility for these plans may be impacted by your chosen medical plan.

## Health Care Flexible Spending Account

A Health Care Flexible Spending Account enables you to pay for qualified health care expenses with pre-tax dollars. You are eligible to enroll in the Health Care Flexible Spending Account if you **do not** enroll in the High Deductible Health Plan.

### Using the Health Care FSA
* You may deposit a minimum of $50 per year up to a maximum of $3,300 per year.
* You may use this account to pay for IRS-qualified health care expenses such as:
  o Health and dental plan deductibles and co-payments
  o Hearing aids, braces, acupuncture
  o Eyeglasses, contact lenses, laser eye surgery, contact lens supplies
  o Prescriptions drugs and over the counter drugs
  o Bandages, gauze pads, and blood pressure monitors
* If you leave Jordan's, you can submit claims for health care expenses incurred up to 5 days following your termination date.

## Limited Purpose Flexible Spending Account

The Limited Purpose Flexible Spending Account is a Flexible Spending Account and works like the Health Care Flexible Spending Account. An LPFSA is a tax-advantaged account that allows you to use pre-tax dollars to pay for qualified **dental and vision** expenses only (not medical expenses).

IRS regulations limit how health spending accounts can be paired. If you enroll in Cigna's Open Access Plus High Deductible Health Plan you may elect to enroll in the Health Savings Account and the Limited Purpose Flexible Spending Account (LPFSA).

### Using the Limited Purpose Health Care FSA
* You may deposit a minimum of $50 per year up to a maximum of $3,300 per year.
* You may use this account to pay for IRS-qualified dental and vision expenses such as:
  o Dental plan deductibles and co-payments
  o Eyeglasses, contact lenses, laser eye surgery, contact lens supplies
* If you leave Jordan's, you can submit claims for dental and vision expenses incurred up to the 5 days following your termination date.

## Health Care and Limited Purpose FSA Balance Rollover

The Health Care and Limited Purpose Flexible Spending Accounts both offer a rollover feature for participants who have a balance in their FSA at year end. Please see the rollover rules below:

* If you have money in your Health Care or Limited Purpose FSA account at the end of the year, you may rollover a maximum of $660. Anything over $660 is forfeited.

22
* If you rollover your Health Care or Limited Purpose FSA money, but do not participate in the FSA the next year, you may use the FSA Debit Card or file a claim for qualified expenses until your balance is zero.

* If you have less than $660 in your Health Care FSA account at the end of the year and you elect the HDHP Plan for the following year, your balance will roll over to the Limited Purpose FSA. You may use the rollover funds for qualified dental and vision expenses only.

## Auto Substantiation for Health Care FSA and Limited Purpose FSA expenses
If you paid for your health care expense using your FSA debit card, Optum Financial will try to automatically verify that your charges were eligible in one of the following ways:
1. Insurance Plan Match - Cigna, Delta Dental and Eye Med Vision send claim feeds to Optum to assist with matching your FSA debit card swipe with your insurance plan.
2. Co-Pay Match - When you use your FSA debit card to pay a copayment that matches our copayments, the transaction will not require further documentation.
3. Recurring Payment Match - If you make regular visits to the same provider and charged the same amount for each visit, your claim may automatically be approved after the first-time documentation is received, reviewed, and approved.
4. Retail Technology - When you use your FSA debit card at participating pharmacies, discount stores, and supermarkets to pay for qualified FSA expenses, no receipts are needed to verify the eligibility of your purchase.

If Optum cannot automatically substantiate your card transaction using one of the ways above, you will be notified within 2-3 weeks that documentation is needed. Save your itemized receipts from every card transaction and the explanation of benefits you receive from the health plans.

## Important IRS Rules Governing Health Care FSA's

Because of the tax advantages of the FSA, the IRS imposes restrictions that you should be aware of before you decide to participate in the program.
* Once enrolled in an FSA, you cannot increase, decrease, or cancel contributions until the next open enrollment period unless you have a qualifying event.

* You may not transfer money from one Flexible Spending Account to the other.

* You may be requested to substantiate a claim, and if the substantiation is not sufficient, not provided, or it is determined to be a non-qualified expense, you will have to reimburse your account by sending a check to Optum Financial or pay back through payroll deductions. Failing to do so would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of your account and you will lose access to your FSA debit card.

* You have until February 28, 2025, to request reimbursement for Health Care FSA expenses incurred January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024.

* Domestic Partner expenses are not eligible because a Domestic Partner is not considered a "legal spouse."
# Health Savings Account

A Health Savings Account (HSA) is an account you establish to pay for qualified health care expenses with tax-free dollars. Under federal guidelines, you must be enrolled in a qualified high deductible health plan to be eligible for a Health Savings Account. Unlike health care flexible spending accounts, you are not obligated to use the money contributed each calendar year. The money can remain in your HSA and earn interest until you need it.

## Advantages of a Health Savings Account

- Tax Savings
  - You can contribute to an HSA through pre-tax payroll deductions.
  - Your interest earnings, employer contribution, and withdrawals for qualified health care expenses are tax-free.
- It's Yours
  - Any unused amounts in your HSA carries over from year to year, it's not use it or lose it.
  - You don't have to worry about forfeiting your contributions at the end of the year.
  - You own your HSA. When you change jobs or retire, your money goes with you.
  - The funds in your account are yours to spend on qualified health care expenses or you can save the funds for future health care needs.
- Jordan's Contributes
  - Employees who enroll in the HDHP Plan on January 1st each year will receive a contribution from Jordan's Furniture of $500 if enrolled in the individual plan or $1,000 if enrolled in the employee plus one or family plan.

## 2025 Health Savings Account Limits

Total employer and employee contributions may not exceed $4,300 for individual coverage or $8,550 for family coverage. Individuals ages 55 or older can make additional "catch-up" contributions of up to $1,000 for 2025.

## Health Savings Account Claims

The Health Savings Account (HSA) offers a unique feature that allows you to access your full annual contribution at any point during the plan year to pay for qualified health care expenses. This means that if you have health care expenses that occur early in the year before contributions to your account have accumulated, you have funds to cover the cost. If you are making your own contributions to your HSA, your scheduled contributions will continue as planned to replenish the amount you use. However, if you leave Jordan's before the end of the year and have used funds that have not been repaid, you may be required to reimburse the outstanding balance.

Examples of eligible health care expenses under the HSA are:
  - Health and dental plan deductibles and co-payments
  - Hearing aids, braces, acupuncture
  - Eyeglasses, contact lenses, laser eye surgery, contact lens supplies
  - Prescriptions drugs and over the counter drugs
  - Bandages, gauze pads, and blood pressure monitors

24
# Health Savings Account Rules & Regulations

- An HSA remains with you even if you change health plans or companies. If you open an HSA and later become ineligible to make contributions, you can still use your remaining funds.
- Funds may be used for any qualified health care expense not covered by insurance or any other plan for yourself, your spouse, or tax dependents.
- Domestic Partner expenses are not eligible because a Domestic Partner is not considered a "legal spouse."
- Funds can be withdrawn for non-health care items but will be subject to regular income taxes and a 20% excise penalty.
- The IRS may request itemized receipts for HSA purchases during tax time. **Always save your itemized receipts!**
- Most taxpayers are eligible for an HSA, unless you meet any qualifications below:
  o You can be claimed as a tax dependent on another person's taxes. Generally, this excludes children under age 19 (or 24 for students), or other household members with limited income who are supported by the taxpayer.
  o You are enrolled in Medicare.
  o Your care is covered by your own or a spouse's non-HSA-qualified health plan, Flexible Spending Account (FSA), or Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA).
  o You are ineligible if, in the past three months, you have received Veteran's Administration benefits that were not connected to a service disability.
- If you leave Jordan's with an unpaid HSA balance, the amount will be added as taxable income to your W2 at the end of the year.
# Payment and Reimbursement for Health Care Accounts

Optum Financial makes it easy to access and use your health care account funds.  There are two ways to pay for health care - use the debit care provided by Optum Financial or pay with your personal funds and request reimbursement.  As always, be sure to provide your health insurance ID card first to ensure the provider processes your claim correctly.

## Paying for Services

- To pay a copay for office visits or prescriptions, you may pay with your payment card, or you may pay using personal funds and request reimbursement online.
- If you're asked to pay for additional charges, do not pay your provider until the claim is processed by your health plan.  When you receive the provider's bill, verify the amount being charged by your provider is the same as the balance on your EOB.  You may then pay using your payment card or pay using personal funds and request reimbursement online.

## Using Your Payment Card

Optum Financial will mail your payment card to the address Jordan's Furniture has on file for you. Below are some tips to use your payment card:

1. Pay for qualified expenses at approved merchants, i.e. doctor's offices, hospitals, and pharmacies.
2. Know your balance in your account by checking your account balance online or via the Optum mobile app.  If you do not have sufficient funds, you may use the card for funds you have left and pay the difference yourself.
3. Use the payment card for qualified expenses only.  If you use the card for ineligible expenses, you will be required to pay back the plan.
4. Save your itemized receipts! You may be asked to supply documentation for health care account claims. Of course, the IRS may also require itemized receipts for tax purposes.

## Account Access at Your Fingertips

**Online** - Accessing your account online allows you to get your account balance, view payment card charges, and request reimbursements.

# Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account

Jordan's offers a Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (FSA) plan to regular Full-Time and regular Part-Time Employees. The plan is administered by Optum Financial. This FSA enables you to pay for your dependent care expenses with pre-tax dollars.

## Calculating Your Contribution

Calculate what you anticipate your IRS-qualified dependent care expenses will be. Then decide what portion of these expenses you would like to pay for with pre-tax dollars. Finally, divide that amount by 52 (or, for new employees divide by the number of payroll weeks remaining in the current year). That is how much will be deducted from your paycheck each week on a pre-tax basis.

## Using the Dependent Care FSA

* You may deposit a minimum of $50 per year up to a maximum of $5,000 per year. If you are married and you and your spouse file separate federal tax returns the maximum amount you can contribute is $2,500 per year.
* You may use this account to pay for IRS-qualified dependent care expenses such as:
   o Day care
   o Pre-school
   o Before/after school day care
   o Summer day camp
   o Elder care (if a qualified dependent)

* A qualifying child is a dependent under the age of 13.
* A qualifying adult dependent is a spouse or elderly parent who is physically or mentally incapable of self-care, who you are primarily responsible for more than 50% of their support and you claim them on your tax return.
* If you leave Jordan's, you can submit claims for Dependent Care expenses incurred up to 5 days following your termination date up to the amount of the balance in your account.

## Important IRS Rules Governing Dependent Care FSA's

Because of the tax advantages of the FSA, the IRS imposes restrictions that you should be aware of before you decide to participate in the program.
* Once enrolled in an FSA, you cannot increase, decrease, or cancel contributions until the next open enrollment period unless you have a qualifying event.
* You may not transfer money from one Flexible Spending Account to the other.
* You are required to use all the money in your Dependent Care FSA account during the Plan Year (January 1st to December 31st). In other words, "Use it or Lose it"!

## Submitting a Claim for Reimbursement
For Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts, you may only receive reimbursement for services already incurred. You have three methods for reimbursement: online, mobile, or paper. All three methods require an itemized statement from the provider containing Providers Name, Dependent's Name, Service Period, Payment Amount, and care provided. You may also complete the Dependent Care Account Claim and Provider Documentation Form.
## Online Claims Submission

### Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act (WHCRA)

The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 ("WHCRA") requires group health plans, insurance issuers and HMOs who already provide medical and surgical benefits for mastectomy procedures to provide insurance coverage for reconstructive surgery following mastectomies. This expanded coverage includes (i) reconstruction of the breast on which the mastectomy has been performed, (ii) surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to produce a symmetrical appearance, and (iii) prostheses and physical complications at all stages of mastectomy, including lymphedemas. These procedures may be subject to annual deductibles and coinsurance provisions that are similar to those applying to other medical or surgical benefits provided under the Group Medical Feature. For answers to specific questions regarding WHCRA benefits, contact the Plan Administrator. Additional state laws may be applicable as more fully described in other materials detailing your medical benefits.

### Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act

Group health plans and health insurance issuers generally may not, under Federal law, restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child to less than 48 hours following a vaginal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a cesarean section. However, Federal law generally does not prohibit the attending provider or physician, after consulting with the mother, from discharging the mother or her newborn earlier than 48 hours (or 96 hours, as applicable). In any case, plans and issuers may not, under Federal law, require that a provider obtain authorization from the plan or the insurance issuer for prescribing a length of stay not more than 48 hours (or 96 hours).

### Patient Protection Act

If the Group Medical Feature in which you are enrolled requires the designation of a primary care provider, you have the right to designate any participating primary care provider who is available to accept you or your family members (for children, you may designate a pediatrician as the primary care provider). For information on how to select a primary care provider and for a list of participating primary care providers, contact the Plan Administrator. You do not need prior authorization from the Plan or from any other person, including your primary care provider, to obtain access to obstetrical or gynecological

41
care from a health care professional; however, you may be required to comply with certain procedures, including obtaining prior authorization for certain services, following a pre-approved treatment plan, or procedures for making referrals. For a list of participating health care professionals who specialize in obstetrics or gynecology, contact the Plan Administrator.

## Coverage For Children Up To Age of 26
The Affordable Care Act of 2010 requires that the Plan must make dependent coverage available to adult children until they turn 26 regardless of if they are married, a dependent or a student.

## Prohibition of Lifetime Dollar Value of Benefits
The Affordable Care Act of 2010 prohibits the Plan from imposing a lifetime limit on the dollar value of benefits.

## Your Health Insurance Cannot be Rescinded
The Affordable Care Act of 2010 prohibits the Plan, or any insurer, from rescinding your health insurance coverage under the Plan for misrepresentation.

## Prohibition of Pre-Existing Conditions
Effective January 1, 2014, The Affordable Care Act of 2010 prohibits the Plan, or any insurer, from denying any health insurance claim for any person because of preexisting condition.

## Prohibition of Restrictions on Annual Limits on Essential Benefits
The Affordable Care Act of 2010 prohibits the Plan, or any insurer, effective January 1, 2014, from placing annual limits on the value of essential health benefits.

## Certificates of Creditable Coverage
Certificates of creditable coverage are written documents provided by the group medical insurer to show the type of health care coverage a person had (e.g., employee only, employee plus family, etc.) and how long the coverage lasted. Under federal law, most group health plans must provide these certificates automatically when a person's coverage terminates. However, if you do not receive a certificate, you have the right to request one. Certificates must be available to both you and your dependents. The primary purpose of the certificates is to show the amount of "Creditable Coverage" that you had because this can reduce or eliminate the length of time that any preexisting condition clause in a new plan otherwise might apply to you. The group medical insurer will automatically give you a certificate after you lose coverage (whether regular coverage or COBRA continuation coverage) and will make reasonable efforts to provide on the certificate the names of your dependents who were also covered. The group medical insurer will provide automatic certificates for your dependents when it has reason to know that they are no longer covered. The group medical insurer will provide a certificate for you (or your dependents) upon request if you make the request within 24 months after your coverage terminates. The Plan Administrator will provide you with proof of your coverage upon request.

## Active Duty or Military Leave
If you take a military leave of absence, you are entitled to continue your coverage under certain insurance benefits under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).
## Leave less than 31 days.
If you are absent from work due to a period of active duty in the military for less than 31 days, your participation in any applicable insurance benefit will not be interrupted, subject to your payment during such period of your regular employee contribution for such coverage.

## Leave 31 days or greater.
If your absence extends for 31 days or greater, you may continue to maintain your coverage under an applicable insurance benefit for up to 24 months from the date your absence for purpose of performing military service began. The Plan Sponsor may require you to pay up to 102% of the full premium under each selected insurance benefit, which represents the Plan Sponsor's share, your share, plus 2% for administrative costs.

## Notice of election
The Plan Administrator may develop reasonable procedures addressing how continuing coverage may be elected, consistent with the terms of the Plan and USERRA. If you think you may be affected by USERRA, contact the Plan Administrator.

## Coordination with COBRA
USERRA continuation coverage is considered alternative coverage for purposes of COBRA. Therefore, if you elect USERRA continuation coverage, COBRA coverage will generally not be available. However, you should contact your Plan Administrator for more information since a continuation of coverage under COBRA may be available to your spouse or dependent children in certain circumstances.

## Qualified Medical Child Support Orders (QMCSO)

A Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO) is an order by a court of law for one parent to provide a child or children with health insurance under this Plan. The Plan Sponsor or Plan Administrator will comply with the terms of any QMCSO it receives, and will:

* Promptly notify you and any alternate recipient (as defined in Section 609(a)(2)(C) of ERISA) of the receipt of a QMCSO and advise you regarding the Plan's health insurance procedures for determining whether a medical child support order is a QMCSO; and
* Establish reasonable procedures to determine whether the court order satisfies the QMCSO requirements as set forth under Section 609 of ERISA; and
* Within a reasonable period of time after receipt of the court order, notify you and each alternate recipient of such determination.

## Notice of COBRA and HIPAA Rights

COBRA is the right to continuation of group health coverage was created by a federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). This section generally explains COBRA continuation coverage, when it may become available to you and your dependents, and what you need to do to receive it.

COBRA continuation coverage is triggered by a life event known as a "qualifying event." Specific qualifying events are listed later in this notice. After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a "qualified beneficiary." You, your spouse, and your dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries if coverage under a group health plan is lost because of the qualifying event. Under the Plan, qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage must pay for it.

If you are an eligible employee, you will become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because either one of the following qualifying events happens:
* Your hours of employment are reduced; or
* Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct.

If you are the spouse of an eligible employee, you will become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because any of the following qualifying events happens:
* Your spouse dies;
* Your spouse's hours of employment are reduced;
* Your spouse's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct;
* Your spouse becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); or
* You become divorced or legally separated from your spouse.

Your dependent children will become qualified beneficiaries if they lose coverage under the Plan because any of the following qualifying events happens:
* The parent-employee dies;
* The parent-employee's hours of employment are reduced;
* The parent-employee's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct;
* The parent-employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both);
* The parents become divorced or legally separated; or
* The child stops being eligible for coverage, i.e., 26 years old, under the plan as a "dependent child."

A child who is born or placed for adoption with the covered employee during a period of COBRA continuation coverage will be eligible to become a qualified beneficiary.

The Plan will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualified beneficiaries only after the Plan Administrator has been notified that a qualifying event has occurred. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of hours of employment, death of the eligible employee, or the eligible employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), the Plan Sponsor will notify the insurance company of the qualifying event.

## You Must Give Notice of Some Qualifying Events. 
For other qualifying events (divorce or legal separation of you and your spouse or a dependent child's losing eligibility for coverage as a dependent child), you must notify the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the qualifying event occurs. You should send this notice, in writing, describing the qualifying event, to the Plan Administrator.

## COBRA Coverage and FMLA Leave. 
The taking of leave under FMLA does not constitute a qualifying event under COBRA. However, a qualifying event will generally occur if your FMLA leave ends and you do not return to work, and you are terminated. Please contact the Plan Administrator for more information on your (and your spouse's or dependent children's) COBRA eligibility during and following FMLA leave.

Once the Plan Administrator receives notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualified beneficiaries. Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. Covered eligible employees may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children.

When the qualifying event is the death of the eligible employee, the eligible employee's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), your divorce or legal separation, or a dependent child's losing eligibility as a dependent child, COBRA continuation coverage lasts for up to a total of 36 months. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the eligible employee's hours of employment, and the eligible employee became entitled to Medicare benefits less than 18 months before the qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage for qualified beneficiaries other than the employee lasts until 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement. For example, if a covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare 8 months before the date on which his employment terminates, COBRA continuation coverage for his spouse and children can last up to 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement, which is equal to 28 months after the date of the qualifying event (36 months minus 8 months). When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the eligible employee's hours of employment, COBRA continuation coverage generally lasts for only up to a total of 18 months. There are two ways in which this 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage can be extended.

## Disability extension of 18-month period of continuation coverage

If you or anyone in your family covered under the Plan is determined by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to be disabled and you notify the Plan Administrator in a timely fashion, you and your entire family may be entitled to receive up to an additional 11 months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a total
maximum of 29 months. To obtain the 11-month extension, you (or a covered family member) must notify the Plan Administrator within 18 months of the original qualifying event.

## Second qualifying event extension of 18-month period of continuation coverage

If your family experiences another qualifying event while receiving 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, the spouse and dependent children in your family can get up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months, if notice of the second qualifying event is properly given to the Plan. This extension may be available to the spouse and any dependent children receiving continuation coverage if the eligible employee or former eligible employee dies, becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), or gets divorced or legally separated, or if the dependent child stops being eligible under the Plan as a dependent child, but only if the event would have caused the spouse or dependent child to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurred. In all of these cases, you must make sure that the Plan Administrator is notified of the second qualifying event within 60 days of the second qualifying event.

COBRA continuation coverage may terminate early if:

* The required premium payment is not paid when due;

* You and your dependents, if any, become covered under another group health plan after the date COBRA coverage is elected that does not contain any exclusion or limitation for any of your preexisting conditions;

* You and your dependents, if any, become entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both) after the date COBRA coverage is elected;

* All of the Plan Sponsor's group health plans are terminated; or

* Coverage is extended to 29 months due to disability, then a determination is made that the individual is no longer disabled. You are required under federal law to inform the Plan Administrator of any final determination that you or your dependents are no longer disabled within 30 days of such a determination.

Continuation coverage under COBRA is provided subject to your eligibility. The Plan Administrator reserves the right to terminate your COBRA coverage retroactively if you are determined to be ineligible for coverage.

Each qualified beneficiary has 60 days from either (1) the date coverage is lost under the Plan or (2) the date they are notified of their right to elect continuation coverage, whichever is later, to inform the Plan Administrator that he or she wants to elect continuation coverage. Each qualified beneficiary has an independent right to elect continuation coverage. For example, both the eligible employee and the eligible employee's spouse may elect continuation coverage, or only one of them. Parents may elect to continue coverage on behalf of their dependent children only. A qualified beneficiary must elect coverage by the date specified on the election notice. Failure to do so will result in loss of the right to elect continuation coverage under the Plan. A qualified beneficiary may change a prior rejection of continuation coverage any time until that date. There is no extension of the election period.

If you or your dependents choose continuation coverage and pay the applicable premium within the time period specified in the qualifying event notice, the Plan Sponsor is required to provide coverage which, as of the time coverage is being provided, is identical to the coverage provided under the Plan to similarly situated active employees or family members. If the Plan Sponsor changes or ends group health coverage for similarly situated active employees, your coverage will also change or end.

Qualified beneficiaries do not have to show that they are insurable to choose continuation coverage. But a qualified beneficiary must have been covered by the Plan the day before the qualifying event in order to elect COBRA coverage.

Generally, each qualified beneficiary may be required to pay the entire cost of continuation coverage. The amount a qualified beneficiary may be required to pay may not exceed 102 % of the cost to the group health
plan (including both employer and employee contributions) for coverage of a similarly situated plan participant or beneficiary who is not receiving continuation coverage (or, in the case of an extension of continuation coverage due to a disability, 150%).

## First payment for continuation coverage

If you elect continuation coverage, you do not have to send any payment for continuation coverage at the time of your election. However, you must make your first payment for continuation coverage within 45 days after the date of your election (This is the date your election notice is postmarked, if mailed) or you could lose coverage.

Your first payment must cover the cost of continuation coverage from the time your coverage under the Plan would have otherwise terminated up to the time you make your first payment. You are responsible for making sure that the amount of your first payment is enough to cover this entire period. Your first payment for continuation coverage should be sent to the COBRA Administrator identified in Administrative Information.

## Periodic payments for continuation coverage

After you make your first payment for continuation coverage, you will be required to pay for continuation coverage for each subsequent month of coverage. Under the Plan, these periodic payments for continuation coverage are due on the 1st of every month. Periodic payments for continuation coverage should be sent to the COBRA Administrator identified in Administrative Information.

## Grace periods for periodic payments

Although periodic payments are due on the 1st of every month, you will be given a grace period of 30 days after the first day of the coverage period to make each periodic payment. Your continuation coverage will be provided for each coverage period if payment for that coverage period is made before the end of the grace period for that payment. However, if you pay a periodic payment later than the first day of the coverage period to which it applies, but before the end of the grace period for the coverage period, your coverage under the Plan will be suspended as of the first day of the coverage period and then retroactively reinstated (going back to the first day of the coverage period) when the periodic payment is received. This means that any claim you submit for benefits while your coverage is suspended may be denied and may have to be resubmitted once your coverage is reinstated. If you fail to make a periodic payment before the end of the grace period for that payment, you will lose all rights to continuation coverage under the Plan.

## Keep your Plan Administrator informed of address changes

To protect your family's rights, you should keep the Plan Administrator informed of any changes in the addresses of family members.

## Notice of Marketplace/Exchange

In addition to continuing your health insurance under COBRA, depending upon your household finances, you and your family may be eligible for subsidized health insurance by contacting a health insurance marketplace or exchange created under the Affordable Care Act. This may be less expensive than COBRA coverage. You can obtain more information on this possibility by contacting healthcare.gov or dialing 1-800-318-2596.

## Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

If neither you nor your dependents enroll for medical or dental coverage offered by the Plan Sponsor when you first become eligible to do so, or during the annual enrollment period, you may be able to enroll under the special enrollment rules under HIPAA that apply when an individual initially declines coverage and later wishes to elect it. A special enrollment opportunity may be available to you if one of the following two situations arises: (a) you initially declined coverage because you had other health care coverage that you have lost through no fault of your own; or (b) since declining coverage when you were eligible to enroll, you have acquired a new dependent (through marriage, or the birth or adoption of a child) and wish to cover that individual. In regard to situation (a) above, at the time you decline coverage,
you must give written notice of your decision to decline coverage to the Plan Administrator and that alternative coverage was your reason for the declination. If you meet the HIPAA special enrollment requirements, you can enroll yourself and all of your dependents in the medical coverage offered by the Plan Sponsor within 30 days after you lose your alternative coverage, such as in situation (a), or the date of your marriage, or the birth, adoption, or placement for adoption of your child, such as in situation (b).

## Statement of ERISA Rights

As a participant in the Jordan's Furniture, Inc. Employee Benefits Plan, you are entitled to certain rights and protection under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA provides that all Plan participants will be entitled to:
- Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office and at other specified locations such as work sites, all Plan documents, including insurance contracts, and copies of all documents, such as detailed annual reports and Plan descriptions, filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Employee Benefits Security Administration.

- Obtain copies of all Plan documents, such as detailed annual reports and Plan descriptions, and other Plan information upon written request to the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator may make a reasonable charge for the copies.

- A certificate of creditable coverage, free of charge, when you lose coverage under group medical insurance, when you become eligible to elect COBRA continuation coverage, when your COBRA continuation coverage ceases, if you request it before losing coverage, or if you request it up to 24 months after losing coverage.

In addition to creating rights for plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the employee benefit plan. The people who operate your plan, called "fiduciaries" of the plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your employer or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.

If your claim for a benefit is denied in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of the documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules.

Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request materials from the Plan Administrator and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file a suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $100 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the Plan Administrator's control.

If you have a claim for benefits that is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file a suit in a state or federal court. In addition, if you disagree with the plan's decision or lack thereof concerning the qualified status of a domestic relations order or a medical child support order, you may file suit in federal court.

If plan fiduciaries misuse the plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.

If you have any questions about your plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S., Department of Labor listed in your telephone directory or 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20250. You may also obtain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration (866) 444-EBSA or online at www.dol.gov/ebsa.
# How to File a Claim
If you wish to file a claim for benefits, you should follow the claim procedures described in your insurance policy or certificate. We must receive a completed claim form. The form must be completed by you, your attending physician, and your employer. If you have any questions about what to do, you should contact us directly.

## Claims Procedures
We will give you notice of the decision no later than 45 days after the claim is filed. This time period may be extended twice by 30 days if we determine that such an extension is necessary due to matters beyond the control of the Plan and notify you of the circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which we expect to render a decision. If such an extension is necessary due to your failure to submit the information necessary to decide the claim, the notice of extension will specifically describe the required information, and you will be afforded at least 45 days from receipt of the notice within which to provide the specified information. If you deliver the requested information within the time specified, any 30-day extension period will begin after you have provided that information. If you fail to deliver the requested information within the time specified, we may decide your claim without that information.

If your claim for benefits is wholly or partially denied, any notice of adverse benefit determination under the Plan will
1. State the specific reason(s) for determination;
2. Reference specific Plan provision(s) on which the determination is based;
3. Describe additional material or information necessary to complete the claim and why such information is necessary;
4. Describe Plan procedure and time limits for appealing the determination, and your right to obtain information about those procedures and the right to sue in federal court; and
5. Disclose any internal rule, guidelines, protocol, or similar criterion relied on in making the adverse determination (or state such information will be provided free of charge upon request).

Notice of the determination may be provided in writing or electronic form. Electronic notices will be provided in a form that complies with any applicable legal requirements.

## Appeals Procedures

You have 180 days from the receipt of Notice of an adverse benefit determination to file an appeal. Requests for appeals should be sent to the address specified in the claim denial. A decision on review will be made not later than 45 days following receipt of the written request for review. If we determine that special circumstances require an extension of time for a decision on review, the review period may be extended by an additional 45 days (90 days in total). We will notify you in writing if an additional 45-day extension is needed.

If an extension is necessary due to your failure to submit the information necessary to decide the appeal, the notice of extension will specifically describe the required information, and you will be afforded at least 45 days from receipt of the notice to provide the specified information. If you deliver the requested

Information within the time specified, the 45 days extension of the appeal period will begin after you have provided that information. If you fail to deliver the required information within the time specified, we may decide your appeal without that information.

You will have the opportunity to submit written comments, documents, or information in support of your appeal. You will have access to all relevant documents as defined by applicable U.S. Department of Labor regulation. The review of the adverse benefit determination will consider all new information, whether or not presented or available at the initial determination. No deference will be afforded to the initial determination.
The review will be conducted by us and will be made by a person different from the person who made the initial determination, and such person will not be the original decision-maker's subordinate. In the case of a claim denied on the grounds of a medical judgment, we will consult with a health professional with appropriate training and experience. The health care professional who is consulted on appeal will not be the individual who was consulted during the initial determination or a subordinate. If the advice of a medical or vocational expert was obtained by the Plan in connection with the denial of your claim, we will provide you with the names of each such expert, regardless of whether the advice was relied upon.

A notice that your request on appeal is denied will contain the following information:
1. The specified reason(s) for the appeal determination;
2. A reference to the specific Plan provision(s) on which the determination is based;
3. A statement disclosing any internal rule, guidelines, protocol or similar criterion relied on in making the adverse determination (or a statement that such information will be provided free of charge upon request);
4. A statement describing your right to bring a civil suit under federal law;
5. A statement that you are entitled to receive upon request, and without charge, reasonable access to
6. or copies of all documents, records, or other information relevant to the determination; and
7. A statement that "You or your plan may have other voluntary alternative dispute resolution option, such as mediation. One way to find out what may be available is to contact your local U.S. Department of Labor Office and your State insurance regulatory agency."

Notice of the determination may be provided in written or electronic form. Electronic notices will be provided in a form that complies with any applicable legal requirements.

Unless there are special circumstances, this administrative appeal process must be completed before you begin any legal action regarding your claim.

## Special Enrollment Relating to Termination of Medicaid or CHIP Coverage and Eligibility for Employment Assistance Under Medicaid or CHIP

A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, must permit an employee who is eligible, but not enrolled, for coverage under the terms of the plan (or a dependent of such an employee if the dependent is eligible, but not enrolled, for coverage under such terms) to enroll for coverage under the terms of the plan if either of the following conditions is met:

- The employee or dependent is covered under a Medicaid plan under Title XIX of the Social Security Act or under a State child health plan ("CHIP") under Title XXI of such Act and coverage of the employee or dependent under such a plan is terminated as a result of loss of eligibility for such coverage and the employee requests coverage under the group health plan (or health insurance coverage) not later than 60 days after the date of termination of such coverage.

- The employee or dependent becomes eligible for assistance, with respect to coverage under the group health plan or health insurance coverage, under such Medicaid plan or State child health plan (including under any waiver or demonstration project conducted under or in relation to such a plan), if the employee requests coverage under the group health plan or health insurance coverage not later than 60 days after the date the employee or dependent is determined to be eligible for such assistance.

## Premium Assistance Under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)

If you or your children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP and you're eligible for health coverage from your employer, your state may have a premium assistance program that can help pay for coverage, using funds from their Medicaid or CHIP programs. If you or your children aren't eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, you won't be eligible for these premium assistance programs, but you may be able to buy
individual insurance coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. For more information, visit www.healthcare.gov.

If you or your dependents are already enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP and you live in a State listed below, contact your State Medicaid or CHIP office to find out if premium assistance is available.

If you or your dependents are NOT currently enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, and you think you or any of your dependents might be eligible for either of these programs, contact your State Medicaid or CHIP office or dial 1-877-KIDS NOW or www.insurekidsnow.gov to find out how to apply. If you qualify, ask your state if it has a program that might help you pay the premiums for an employer-sponsored plan.

If you or your dependents are eligible for premium assistance under Medicaid or CHIP, as well as eligible under your employer plan, your employer must allow you to enroll in your employer plan if you aren't already enrolled. This is called a "special enrollment" opportunity, and you must request coverage within 60 days of being determined eligible for premium assistance. If you have questions about enrolling in your employer plan, contact the Department of Labor at www.askebsa.dol.gov or call 1-866-444-EBSA (3272).

# Glossary of Benefit Terms

**Beneficiary** - A person designated as the recipient of funds or other property under a will, trust, insurance policy, 401k, etc.

**COBRA** - The federal law that requires a group health plan to offer qualified employees and dependents, enrolled in the group health plan, the opportunity to continue the same coverage after you cease to be enrolled. It gives you, and your dependents, the opportunity to continue your existing level of medical coverage while paying 102% of the cost.

**Co-insurance** - The percentage of out-of-network covered expenses paid by you after you meet your deductible (20% coinsurance means that you pay 20% of the expenses).

**Copayment** - A relatively small, fixed fee required by a health insurer to be paid by the patient at the time of each office visit, outpatient service, or filling of a prescription

**Deductible** - The amount you must pay out-of-pocket for expenses before the insurance company will cover the remaining costs.

**Emergency Care** - Care provided for a medical, surgical, or psychiatric condition that requires immediate care to save a life or prevent permanent impairment. Emergency care is typically sought for a serious accidental injury or sudden onset of an acute medical condition, such as a suspected heart attack or a stroke.

**Evidence of Insurability** - A record of a person's past and current health events used by insurance companies to determine whether a person meets the definition of good health to obtain coverage in the insurance plan.

**Explanation of Benefits (EOB)** - Also called a Claims Summary. It advises whether a plan covers a medical service that has been received, as well as lists the allowable reimbursement amounts; any deductibles, co-insurance, or other adjustments taken; and the net amount paid.

**Flexible Spending Account (FSA)** - An employer plan which allows you to set aside a portion of your earnings to pay for qualified expenses as established in the IRS, most commonly for medical expenses and dependent care. Money deducted from your pay into an FSA is not subject to payroll taxes, resulting in a substantial payroll tax savings.

**Generic Drug** - A drug that is a chemical and therapeutic equivalent of a brand-name drug for which the patent has expired. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than the equivalent brand-name drugs.

**Imputed Income** - A value that the IRS applies to any benefit or service that should be considered income for the purposes of calculating your federal taxes.

**In-Network** - Care received from a provider that is within the approved network of physicians as described by the health plan option covering you.

**Lifetime maximum** - The maximum amount the plan will pay in benefits for each covered person in a lifetime.

**Mail Order Drug** - A pharmacy that dispenses maintenance prescriptions through the mail. This saves you money because you can purchase a 90-day supply for the same co-payment you pay for a 30-day supply at a retail pharmacy.

**Non-preferred Drug** - The drug which has generic or preferred brand-name alternatives and has the highest co-payment.

**Open Enrollment** - A period of time, occurring once per year, when you can make additions, changes or deletions to your elected benefit options. You can only make changes in benefits elections during open enrollment or if you experience a specific qualifying event.

**Out-of-Network** - Care received from a provider that is not part of the approved network of providers or care that is not directed by your primary care physician.

**Out-of-pocket maximum** - The maximum amount of covered medical and surgical expenses you and your family could pay each year.

**Preferred Drug** - A brand-name drug that has a slightly higher co-payment.

**Pre-tax Deduction** - A deduction for a Section 125 benefit which is taken out of your paycheck prior to taxes, therefore lowering your taxable income.

**Qualifying Event** - For you to enroll into a group insurance plan midyear, you need to experience a qualifying event. Common examples would be marriage, birth, or adoption, a voluntary or involuntary termination of your spouse's or domestic partner's employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct) or reduction of your spouse's
or domestic partner's hours (which causes loss of coverage); the death of your spouse or domestic partner; or divorce, termination of domestic partnership or legal separation from your spouse or domestic partner.

**Reasonable and Customary** - The range of fees for comparable services charged by the medical or dental professionals in a geographic area. If your provider charges more than the reasonable and customary fee, you may be responsible for paying the difference. Any charges in excess of reasonable and customary will not apply toward your annual deductible or out-of-pocket limit. Reasonable and customary limits do not apply for in-network.

**Section 125 Plan** - Allows employees to pay for health coverage on a pre-tax basis. Premiums paid with pre-tax dollars are not subject to state and federal income taxes or federal FICA withholding taxes.

**Summary Annual Report (SAR)** -A document distributed to all participants in a health and welfare or retirement plan at the end of the financial year. The summary annual report contains financial and related information about the plans.

**Summary Plan Description (SPD)** - A document that explains the fundamental features of an employer's benefit plan, including eligibility requirements, contributions, vesting schedules, benefit calculations, and distribution options.

**Urgent Care** - Care needed to treat an unforeseen condition that requires immediate medical treatment in the outpatient department of a hospital, clinic, or doctor's office for the treatment of acute pain, acute infection, or protection of public health. An urgent condition is not life-threatening but may cause serious medical problems if not promptly treated
